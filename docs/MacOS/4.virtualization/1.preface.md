# Preface

If you're reading this, you probably have a MacBook with an M1, M2, M3, or any M-series chip and want to run MultiSim on it. Unfortunately, MultiSim isn't available for macOS, and running it on an Apple Silicon MacBook isn't as simple as installing it on a Windows PC. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a virtual machine on your MacBook to run Windows and install MultiSim. You can skip this section and go straight to the [guide](prerequisites) if you're already familiar with the situation.

## What's the issue?

The newer MacBooks, released in 2020 and later, use Apple's own M-series Apple Silicon chips, which are based on the ARM architecture. These processors are different from the Intel processors used in older MacBooks, which are based on the x86 architecture. MultiSim is a Windows application that is designed to run on x86 processors, and it is not compatible with ARM processors like the ones used in Apple Silicon MacBooks.

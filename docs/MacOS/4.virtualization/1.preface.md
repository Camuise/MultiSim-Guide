# Preface

If you have a Mac with an M-series chip and want to run MultiSim, this guide is for you. MultiSim isn't available for macOS, and running it on an Apple Silicon Mac requires setting up a virtual machine to run Windows. If you're already familiar with this, you can skip to the [guide](prerequisites).

## Why do we need a virtual machine?

Newer Macs, released from 2020 onwards, use Apple's M-series chips, which are different from the older Intel processors. MultiSim is a Windows program made for Intel / AMD processors, so it doesn't work directly on the new M-series Macs.

## Virtualizing Windows

To run MultiSim on your Apple Silicon Mac, you can to virtualize Windows. Virtualization runs a version of Windows made for the kind of chip that the M-series chips are, providing better performance than emulation. This method gives better performance but may be less stable than emulation, as you're instead relying on Windows to do the translating of MultiSim's code to work on the M-series chips.

:::note
Technically, this method is supposed to be less stable than emulation, but in practice, it's not any less stable. During testing, MultiSim was running fine and didn't crash or freeze. However, your mileage may vary, so keep this in mind.

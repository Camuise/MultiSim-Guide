# Identifying Your Mac

MultiSim is not officially supported on macOS, but you can still install it using a virtual machine or Boot Camp. The method you choose depends on your Mac's hardware.

To identify your Mac, click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your screen and select "About This Mac." This will display your Mac's model and specifications, which are crucial for determining the installation method.

Pay attention to the "Processor" or "Chip" field:

- If it says `Intel Core i` whatever, follow the guide for [Boot Camp](2.boot-camp/1.preface.md).
- If it says `Apple M` whatever, you have two options for virtual machines:
  - **Prioritize Stability**: Follow the guide for [emulating Windows](3.emulation/1.preface.md).
  - **Prioritize Performance**: Follow the guide for [virtualizing Windows](4.virtualization/1.preface.md).

Choose the method that best suits your needs. Don't worry if you don't understand the terminology yet; the guides will explain everything in detail.

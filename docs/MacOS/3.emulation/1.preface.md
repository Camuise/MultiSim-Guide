# Preface

If you have a Mac with an M-series chip and want to run MultiSim, this guide is for you. MultiSim isn't available for macOS, and running it on an Apple Silicon Mac requires setting up a virtual machine to run Windows. If you're already familiar with this, you can skip to the [guide](prerequisites).

## Why do we need a virtual machine?

Newer Macs, released from 2020 onwards, use Apple's M-series chips, which are different from the older Intel processors. MultiSim is a Windows program made for Intel / AMD processors, so it doesn't work directly on the new M-series Macs.

## Emulating Windows

To run MultiSim on your Apple Silicon Mac, you can to emulate Windows. Emulation translates MultiSim's code to work on M-series chips but is much slower than running Windows natively on an Intel Mac. This method ensures stability but requires patience due to the performance cost.

:::warning
Emulating Windows on an M-series Mac is slow and resource-intensive. Ensure you have at least 16GB of memory/ RAM and 64GB of free storage. If not, consider [virtualizing Windows](../4.virtualization/1.preface.md) instead. To check your Mac's specifications, click the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your screen and select "About This Mac."
